right ideal (resp., ﬁnitely generated right ideal) of R is projective. Similarly, left hereditary and left semihereditary rings are deﬁned.

# 2 DECOMPOSITIONS INTO PROJECTIVE AND STABLE SUBMODULES

In this section, we mention some rings over which the decomposition of some modules into projective and stable submodules occurs.

A submodule K of M is called essential in M , if for every submodule L of M , L ∩ K = 0 implies L = 0, and it is denoted by K ≤ e M . A nonzero module M is said to be a uniform module if every nonzero submodule of M is an essential submodule. An R -module M R is said to have uniform dimension (= Goldie dimension ) n , denoted by u . dim( M ) = n , where n is a positive integer, if there is an essential submodule N of M such that N is the direct sum of n (nonzero) uniform submodules. The zero module is deﬁned to have a uniform dimension 0. If for a nonzero module M , there exists no positive integer n such that u . dim( M ) = n , then we write u . dim( M ) = ∞ (this will hold if and only if M contains an inﬁnite direct sum of nonzero submodules); otherwise, we write u . dim( M ) < ∞ . A submodule K of M is said to be small in M if for every submodule L of M , K + L = M implies L = M . An R -module M is said to be hollow ( = couniform) if M   = 0 and every proper submodule N of M is small in M . A ﬁnite set { N i | i ∈ I } of proper submodules of M is said to be coindependent if N i +     j   = i N j   = M for every i ∈ I , or, equivalently, if the canonical injective mapping M/   i ∈ I N i → ⊕ i ∈ I M/N i is bijective. An arbitrary set A of proper submodules of M is said to be coindependent if its ﬁnite subsets are coindependent. A module M is said to have ﬁnite hollow dimension (= couniform dimension = dual Goldie dimension ) n , denoted by h . dim( M ) = n , where n is a positive integer, if there exists a coindependent set { N 1 ,N 2 ,... ,N n } of proper submodules of M with M/N i hollow for all i and N 1 ∩ N 2 ∩··· ∩ N n is small in M . The zero module is deﬁned to have a hollow dimension 0. If for a nonzero module M , there exists no positive integer n such that h . dim( M ) = n , then we write h . dim( M ) = ∞ (this holds if and only if there exist an iﬁnite coindependent set of proper submodules of M ); otherwise, we write h . dim( M ) < ∞ . See [11, Sections 2.6, 2.7, 2.8] and [19, Section 6A].

Theorem 2.1. If a module M cannot be decomposed as M = P ⊕ N where P is a projective submodule and N is a stable submodule, then there exists a sequence ( P k ) ∞ k =1 of nonzero proper projective submodules of M and a sequence ( N k ) ∞ k =1 of nonzero proper submodules of M such that for every k ∈ Z + ,

$$
Pk-1 € P1 with Nk = Nk+1 Pk+l,
$$

Proof. If M were a projective module or a stable module, then it would have a decomposition of the required form trivially. So M must be a module which is not projective, and since it is not stable, it can be decomposed as M = P ⊕ N for some submodules P and N where P is a nonzero projective module. Then N is not projective since otherwise, M = P ⊕ N would be a projective module. In particular, N   = 0. If N were stable, then M = P ⊕ N would be a decomposition into a direct sum of a projective submodule and a stable submodule. So N is not a stable module. Thus, N is neither projective nor stable. Now argue as for M . The module N should have a nonzero projective direct summand, that is, N = P 1 ⊕ N 1 for some nonzero projective submodule P 1 and a submodule N 1 which is not projective and not stable. Continuing in this way by induction, we obtain a sequence ( P k ) ∞ k =1 of nonzero proper projective submodules of M and a sequence ( N k ) ∞ k =1 of nonzero proper submodules of M such that

$$
M = Nk € Pk P1 with Nk = for all k € 7+ . Nk+1
$$

Since P i   = 0 for all i ∈ I , u . dim( P i ) ≥ 1 and so for every n ∈ Z + , u . dim( M ) = u . dim( N n P n ⊕ P n − 1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ P 1 ) ≥ n by [19, 6.6]. Therefore u . dim( M ) = ∞ . Similarly h . dim( M ) = ∞ should hold using the properties of hollow dimension, see [11, Section 2.8] 3
